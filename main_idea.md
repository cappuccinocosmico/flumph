Okay, so I am wanting to go ahead and get a job in the crypto industry, and I am wanting to go ahead and work on a framework for a distributed open source hardware system to display hirable skills on github.

I think that a lot of the crypto community right now is really focused on building trustless computational solutions that dont have a lot of real world applications. Where more distributed open systems, expecially in areas of municipal infrastructure could be more practical and lead to more sustainable revenue streams that dont depend on financial speculation of underlying coins.

The main demo use cases would be something like:

- A weather station that could



I would like this framework to be usable with a lot of different kinds of peripherals and consumer hardware, namely it should be possible to run nodes on:

- an ESP-32
- an app on an android phone, (that can access sensors through the usb-c port)
- a regular desktop linux app
